Of course! It's essential to have a clear and simple guide for starting and stopping your work.

Here are the commands, broken down into the two main tasks. You will need three separate terminals for the "start" process.

How to Stop Everything

You can do this in any order.

Stop the Frontend Server:

Go to the terminal running your React app (the one in the frontend folder).

Press Ctrl + C.

Stop the Backend Server:

Go to the terminal running your Node.js app (the one in the backend folder).

Press Ctrl + C.

Stop the Database Containers:

Go to a terminal and navigate to your deploy folder.

Run the following command:

docker-compose down
```    (This command safely stops and removes the containers. Your data is safe because we use Docker volumes).
How to Start Everything

The order is important here: Databases → Backend → Frontend.

(Terminal 1) Start the Databases:

Navigate to your deploy folder.

Run the following command to start PostgreSQL and MongoDB in the background:

docker-compose up -d


(The -d means "detached", so it won't lock up your terminal).

(Terminal 2) Start the Backend Server:

Navigate to your backend folder.

Run the development script:

npm run dev

Wait until you see the success messages ✅ Connected to PostgreSQL successfully... and ✅ Connected to MongoDB successfully. before moving to the next step.

(Terminal 3) Start the Frontend Application:

Navigate to your frontend folder.

Run the development script:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
npm run dev

Your browser should open to http://localhost:5173, where you'll see the login screen.
